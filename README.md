An inventory tracking system that allows the admin to track the items and
appointments requests made by the users.
The website should allow the admin to make a list of equipment, where items can
belong to more than one category. The system must have full information about
and images for each item.
Related to the request process, i.e., when a user is filling the request form in order
to get an item(s), s/he must select the item(s) and select the time(you need to show
the user a calendar). Also, the status of each item must be shown (available, not
available, out of order, etc.). According to the availability of the item(s) only, the
request can be sent to the admin to be approved. In other words, users can select
items during their available days only.
In addition to the equipment, users may request to use the studio and editing rooms
should (to be shown in a separate section), and a system to check availability of
these rooms as well as requesting using these rooms must be available.
Generally, this website helps users to request items and rooms, where they can
log into the system. Then, approval should be made by the admin according to the
availability of items(equipment and rooms) and the details of the user’s request.
After the users' account is approved by the admin, users can log in to the website
and can request items or rooms in the inventory by specifying the reasons for the
request (why they need the selected items) and the date and duration they want to
get the items or use the rooms. On the other hand, the system must show the admin
all requests and their status, where the status of the requested item or room is not
updated until approval is made by the admin.
